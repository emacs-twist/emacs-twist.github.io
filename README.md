# A Landing Page for Emacs Twist

This is a trivial web site for https://github.com/emacs-twist.

## Development

The web site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/).

You need the following programs for development:

- A recent version of node.js
- pnpm

Those programs are made available from Nix + direnv, so you don't have to
install them if you are using Nix.

To preview, run a development server of Astro:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

## Deployment

At present, the web site is deployed to GitHub Pages. The published site is
available at https://emacs-twist.github.io/
